# TestNG Automation Framework

This repository contains comprehensive examples and test cases built using **TestNG** framework in Java. It demonstrates various features and capabilities of TestNG through organized test suites and scenarios.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple modules, each focusing on specific TestNG functionalities:

- **BasicFeatures** – Introduction to TestNG annotations, assertions, enable/disable tests.
- **FormValidation** – Validating form inputs, menu interactions, and account editing.
- **GroupTests** – TestNG groups, inclusion/exclusion logic, and multi-group execution.
- **DataDrivenTests** – Using `@DataProvider`, multi-dimensional and iterator-based inputs.
- **OrderTests** – Placing orders with and without POM (Page Object Model).
- **WishlistTests** – Wishlist functionality tests and HTML reporting.

## 🧪 Key Features Demonstrated

- TestNG Annotations (`@Test`, `@BeforeClass`, etc.)
- Assertions: `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `SoftAssert`, etc.
- Groups and Exclusion
- Parameterized Testing via `@DataProvider`
- Multiple Test Classes and XML configurations
- Page Object Model (POM) Implementation
- HTML Report Generation

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Run the `.xml` files inside the `XLM` folders to execute desired test suites.
